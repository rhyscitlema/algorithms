
Fast C implementation of library-algorithms.
These can be used in a program as sub-routines.

*** Please refer mainly to the header files,
*** the source files are like Pandora's boxes!

The header files show which algorithms are
implemented or which algorithmic problems
are solved, and available documentation.

To compile execute:
    gcc -c -Wall -I . -o algorithms.o algorithms.c
